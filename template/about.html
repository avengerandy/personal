                For the experience of work.
                I was start working as a programmer when I was junior.
                Mainly focused on the web backend and android app. <br>
                My first job is about Wi-Fi service.
                The main concept is to use PHP as a middleware try to implementation business logic
                between radius AAA server and Wi-Fi hotspots.
                (e.g. interact with advertisement API and control user permission). <br>
                My second job is in a software outsourcing company.
                Mainly in charge of crawler and design common website.
                (e.g. official website、blog and online shopping website). <br>
                Besides above, I also work on a piecework basis on my free time.

                For the experience of research.
                I'm interests include Evolutionary Computation、Convolutional Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. <br>
                My main research field is Evolutionary Computation specialized in real-code optimization.
                For the related research results,
                I was publishing a conference paper on 2019 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation as a second author
                when I was first year of graduate school. <br>
                Besides above, I also try to understanding and implementation other field in my free time.
                For example, I have been trying Convolutional Neural Networks in image classification and
                using Reinforcement Learning on Automated Machine Learning.
